## Project Overview

Nuclear is a free software music player for Linux, Mac, and Windows built with modern web technologies and packaged with Electron. It streams music from free sources, supporting various online sources and local audio files.

### Architecture

The project is structured as a monorepo using Lerna with the following packages:

- **app**: The renderer process of the Electron app containing the React-based UI and user interaction logic
- **core**: Shared core functionality and utilities used across packages
- **ui**: Reusable React UI components with snapshot tests
- **i18n**: Internationalization resources and translations
- **main**: Electron main process with business logic organized using Inversify dependency injection
- **scanner**: Rust module for scanning and indexing local music libraries

### Key Technologies

- **Frontend**: React, Redux, TypeScript, SCSS
- **Backend**: Electron, Node.js, Inversify
- **Local Scanner**: Rust
- **Build System**: Webpack, Lerna
- **Testing**: Jest
- **Package Management**: npm with workspaces

## Core Functionality

### Music Playback

Nuclear's main capability is playing music from various sources. The player component (`Sound` from 'react-hifi') handles regular audio streams while `HLSPlayer` handles HLS streams.

Key playback features:

- Play/pause/stop controls
- Track seeking
- Volume control and muting
- Playback rate control
- Queue management (next/previous, shuffle, repeat)

### Music Sources

Nuclear can stream music from:

- Online sources via plugins (stream providers)
- Local music libraries (via the scanner package)
- External playlists (Spotify, Deezer)

### UI Components

- **Search**: Universal search functionality across all sources
- **PlayerBar**: Main playback control bar at the bottom of the application
- **MiniPlayer**: Compact player window
- **PlayQueue**: List of tracks queued for playback
- **Visualizer**: Audio visualization effects
- **Dashboard**: Home screen with playlists, top tracks, and genre exploration
- **Equalizer**: Audio frequency adjustment interface
- **Library**: Local music file browser
- **Playlists**: User-created collections of tracks
- **Settings**: User preferences and configurations

### Plugin System

Nuclear uses a plugin-based architecture for:

- Stream providers (sources of music)
- Metadata providers (artist/album info)
- Lyrics providers

Users can select preferred providers and even add custom plugins.

### State Management

The application uses Redux for state management with the following key stores:

- **player**: Playback status, volume, seek position
- **queue**: Track queue, current track
- **playlists**: User and remote playlists
- **settings**: User preferences
- **favorites**: User favorites (tracks, albums, artists)
- **plugin**: Available and selected plugins

## Directory Structure Insights

### App Package (`packages/app/app`)

- `actions`: Redux actions
- `components`: React components organized by feature
- `containers`: Component containers with Redux connections
- `hooks`: Custom React hooks
- `reducers`: Redux reducers
- `selectors`: Redux selectors
- `store`: Redux store configuration and middleware

### Main Package (`packages/main/src`)

- `controllers`: IPC event handlers
- `services`: Core services (HTTP API, IPC, Discord integration, etc.)
- `ioc.ts`: Inversify dependency injection container setup
- `utils`: Utility functions specific to the main process

### UI Package (`packages/ui/lib`)

- `components`: Shared, reusable UI components
- `forms`: Components specifically for building forms
- `hooks`: UI-related hooks
- `common.scss`: Common styles shared across UI components

### Core Package (`packages/core/src`)

- `ipc`: Definitions and types related to IPC communication
- `logger`: A universal logger for both main and renderer processes
- `persistence`: Electron store
- `plugins`: Streaming, metadata, and lyrics plugins
- `settings`: Default settings and setting management
- `structs`: Core data structures used across packages
- `types`: Shared TypeScript types and interfaces
- `helpers`, `util`: General utility functions

### i18n Package (`packages/i18n/src`)

- `locales/`: JSON translation files for different languages

### Scanner Package (`packages/scanner/src`)

- `lib.rs`: Rust library entry point (Neon module registration)
- `scanner.rs`: Main logic for scanning directories
- `metadata.rs`: Logic for extracting metadata from audio files
- `local_track.rs`: Data structure for representing local tracks
- `thumbnails.rs`: Logic for generating thumbnails

## Communication Patterns

- **IPC Communication**: The renderer process communicates with the main process via IPC events defined in `IpcEvents`
- **Redux Actions**: State changes within the renderer are managed through Redux actions
- **Hooks**: Modern functional components use custom hooks for behavior reuse

## Common Development Workflows

### Root Level Scripts

These scripts should be run from the project root directory:

- `npm start`: Starts the development servers for both the main and renderer processes concurrently.
- `npm run build`: Builds all packages and then packs the application for distribution.
- `npm test`: Runs tests across all packages.
- `npm run lint`: Lints the code in all relevant packages.

## Testing Approach

- **UI Components**: Snapshot tests for visual regression
- **Integration Tests**: For testing components in context
- **Unit Tests**: For core business logic and utilities
- **End-to-End Tests**: For full application flows
- We mostly write integration tests for everything in the `app` package. Avoid unit tests for components, containers, and utility functions. It's better to mount a large part of the music player and test it as a whole.
- We want the tests to accurately reflect the behavior of the music player. Avoid mocking unless necessary. Any setup should be done by performing the same actions as the user: clicking buttons, typing text, etc.
- Snapshot tests should be created for every new component in the `ui` package.
- Tests with smaller scope are usually written in the `core` package. Creating unit tests is fine there.

## Coding Principles

- Use modern React and Typescript style. Prioritize readability over "clever" code.
- Always write the complete code for every step. Don't add placeholders, todos, or other missing pieces.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns, avoid classes and mutable state.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g. `isPlaying`, `isPaused`, `hasError`).
- Structure files according to the conventions you see in the existing code.
- Never use `any` as a type. Always type things according to your best judgment. Use `unknown` only when it's logically permissible.
- Use generic types when it's useful or necessary.
- Prefer arrow functions: () => {} over function expressions: function() {}.
- If you're unsure, stick to the existing code style.
- Be fun, approachable, patient, and passionate.
- Code should be professional.
- Class names in SCSS files use underscores, e.g. `.music_player`.
- Most components have an `index.tsx` file that exports the component as the default export. Follow this convention.
- NEVER add any comments unless you're asked for it. If you need to explain something, you can do it in the chat.

## Advanced Functionality

### Scrobbling

Nuclear can scrobble played tracks to Last.fm if the user has configured their account.

### Discord Integration

Shows currently playing track in Discord Rich Presence.

### Visualizer

Audio visualization with various effects.

### Equalizer

Audio frequency adjustment with presets.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

Keyboard navigation and control via Mousetrap library.

### Mastodon Integration

Optional posting to Mastodon when tracks play.

## Common Challenges

1. **Stream Provider Issues**: Handle errors gracefully when streams fail to load
2. **Performance Optimization**: Large libraries and playlists need virtualized lists
3. **Plugin Compatibility**: Ensure plugin changes don't break existing functionality
4. **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Behavior should be consistent across operating systems
5. **Legacy Code**: There is still some legacy Javascript code that needs to be converted to Typescript. Very occasionally, some React components are still written in class-based style. If you see any, convert them to functional components.
